# Welcome

Welcome to my blog! I hope you will find here a lot of interesting information related to Open Source and Cloud Native technologies.

# What is this blog about ?

The main goal of this blog is to document my personal journey of setting up my home lab. This lab is going to play a role of my private cloud. The idea is to share with others like you, how to use the most up to date Cloud Native Open Source tools to build your home cloud 

# Assumptions

The main assumptions of my project are:

- It should be not very expensive.
- All the available programs and solutions must be Open Source.
- The solution must be as much automated as possible.
- The Infrastructure as a Code as well as GitOps is playing the central role.
- The Kubernetes is always in the hearth of the proposed solutions.

# Final words

If you enjoy my blog, I would be very happy if you share it with your colleagues and help me spread this knowledge. You can also leave a comments if you found something not clear, bad or just want to discuss different approaches. Thanks for visiting!
